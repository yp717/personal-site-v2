description: Why I'm developing a writing habit for my learning and sharing with others
---

Just before Corona Virus hit and the UK put the country in a state of lock-down on the 23rd of March, I set out to redesign my personal website and continue developing my programming skills. I know I want to work in software and my degree has not always given me the most direct exposure to the field and the technologies I want to work with. The more that I think about it, I've also lost touch with something I once loved to do: writing.

I've already spent the last few weeks working on a series of software projects. BUT, this post is a commitment to starting **a writing habit**. I hope that it won't just be an opportunity to reinforce the new things I'm learning about, but also to wrap my head about more complicated topics as well as share some of what I uncovered going through the process so that it maybe even helps someone else too.

As I learn more, work through more courses and tutorials, and build more awesome stuff, I will do my best to document what I'm working on in an attempt to stay more focused, solidify my learning and share with others.
