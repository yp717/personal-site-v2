This project is still in progress and so this part of the site will be updated soon!

In short, we're using Machine Learning to develop models to create patient risk scores for COVID-19 and for probabilistic inference for a clinical decision support system in the NHS called EPiC IMPOC run by the Centre of BioInspired Technology at Imperial College London.
