description: The first iteration of my personal website; a simple single page static site for a personal website or portfolio made with ReactJS, GatsbyJS, SASS, and Netlify
---

The first version of my personal portfolio website made with GatsbyJS, ReactJS, SASS and designed with Sketch. What was interesting about this design was, firstly, that it was one of the first independent web development projects that I ever worked on. I tried to make the site stand out and look different in some way, so although it was a simple static one page site, it made use of a two column structure on desktop devices that, in principle, keeps all the important information I wanted people to see in the panel on the left at all times.

Quite a few people have asked, and yes, I did draw the lego character myself. If you want to know more about how I built this site, check out the repository on [github](https://github.com/yp717/personalWebsite)!
