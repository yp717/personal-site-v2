description: DesignRant is a blog site made for authors first. Some have called it the new home for short, sharp, user experience complaints for developers and designers alike.

[DesignRant](https://designrant.app) is about to be the home of "Short, sharp, user experience complaints". It's exactly what it sounds like: short - capped at 1000 word - rants about our experiences on the internet. The project was started by a close mentor and friend of mine called Sam Larsen Disney. As an aside, if you haven't already, you should absolutely check out his [website](https://sld.codes), it's brilliant.

What started as a place for him and a few friends to write quickly evolved into a much larger project, and eventually, the perfect place for young UX designers and developers to share their rants, their critiques, and their visions for the User Experiences and User Interfaces that live on the web.

The project now lives as an open source organization on Github that will continue to grow and the site will officially launch later this week, with more than 300 sign ups before the site even launched. I am now a contributor to the project both as a developer and a content contributor. This is one of the first (hopefully of many), growing, open source projects that I am contributing to and I'm really excited about it.

A key element of DesignRant, is that while many of the posts are often critical, and sometimes even controversial, you can be as negative as you like so long as you propose a solution. It's easy to complain but it's a lot harder to pick out the limitations of current designs and propose alternatives that could potentially improve experiences for users and that's what it's all about. This will hopefully help with making our users and readers more aware of the importance of considering usability, accessibility and design at every step of the development process.

The large number of reader sign-ups on the site before it even launched, suggest it will be a great place for developers and designers to get exposure. Every author has an author page and bio with links to their social media and a place to "buy them a coffee." For this reason, if this sounds like you or you know someone who might be interested, please do share and get involved.

The site launches at [DesignRant](https://designrant.app) later this week and I can't wait to see you there.
