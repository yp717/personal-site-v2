This project on the website is in progress and is coming soon.<span aria-label="image">ðŸ¤­</span>

Weâ€™re a team of second year Electrical and Elec- tronic Engineering students at Imperial College London. We began planning this project in early October, with the vision to improve peopleâ€™s daily lives.
Six months later, we have developed an end-to-end instant, reliable, and secure super- market checkout system using UHF RFID technol- ogy. Wedecided to kick off our project at ICHACK2019 and built a first working prototype in under 24 hours, winning the DocSocâ€™s choice award.

WHAT IS UHF RFID?

UHF RFID is an acronym for "Ultra- high-frequen- cy radio-frequency identification" and refers to a technology whereby digital data encoded in tags (consisting of an integrated circuit and an anten- na) is captured by a reader via radio waves. UHF RFID is similar to barcoding in that tag data can be used to identify supermarket items. It has, however, several advantages over systems that use barcodes. The most notable is that tag data can be read outside the line-of-sight and from large distances (up to 500m).

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

Improving customerâ€™s shopping experience is at the heart of our mission at RFID Checkout. We aim to get the customer out of the store faster, without the long queue time and stress associated with traditional checkout systems.

We aimed for a traditional modular design where multiple units could be placed side by side. Our lightweight and strong aluminum frame gives us flexibility in design, allowing for hidden wiring and optimal antenna placement.

FACIAL RECOGNITION
Our face identification feature speeds up payment phase even further by recognizing clients in a matter of seconds.

We use OpenCV for predetection and Microsoft's Azure AI for customer recognition.

OUR SOFTWARE

The checkout software was designed with ease of use in mind. Weâ€™ve tried hard to keep it simple to minimize adaptation time for older consumers.
The app is built on top of Electronjs, using various web technologies
