JSEscape is an online learning platform that aims to teach and develop JavaScript skills using interactive storytelling. The problem with many existing coding platforms for assessment and teaching is that they get dry and boring quickly. When Sam Larsen Disney from [sld.codes](https://sld.codes) and I set out to build JSEscape, we thought there had to be a better way to improve engagement in coding tests.

The basic principle of JSEscape is that coding tests and practice shouldn't be a pain and that storytelling is a powerful but underused tool in education. By integrating unique and exciting story content, JSEscape tries to make learning JavaScript and general coding skills and concepts more interactive and fun.
