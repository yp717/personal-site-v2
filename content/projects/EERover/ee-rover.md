This project on the website is in progress and is coming soon. If we make this longer does the sentence get longer Im not sure what is going on here Ohhhh that seems to be the case now it is the correct width. <span aria-label="image">ðŸ¤­</span>

Maybe it would be better if we filled in the content everywhere first and then decided on how we want to format the content so that it looks good on the website!

Let's quickly test the KaTeX to see if its working

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
