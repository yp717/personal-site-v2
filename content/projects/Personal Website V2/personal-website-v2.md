description: The second iteration of my personal website, re-built from scratch with ReactJS, GatsbyJS, GraphQL, SASS, Gatsby Cloud, Netlify, and Markdown
---

This is the second version of my personal portfolio website made with GatsbyJS, ReactJS, SASS and designed with Sketch. This design started earlier in 2020 when I decided that a simple static content site wasn't interesting enough anymore and I wanted to develop something more complicated with the JAMStack ecosystem. The second iteration of my personal site also includes project posts, blog posts, tags and  programmatically generated projects using GraphQL.

The design is new and fresh and also features a (completely necessary) dark-mode toggle. Building a personal website and defining a personal brand is a continuous process, so this site is constantly being updated with new content and features. If you want to know more about how I built this site, check out the repository on [github](https://github.com/yp717/personal-site-v2)!
