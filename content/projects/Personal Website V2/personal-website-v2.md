description: Revamping my personal site from a static one page site
color: regal-blue
---

This is the second version of my personal portfolio website made with GatsbyJS, ReactJS, SASS and designed with Sketch. This design started earlier in 2020 when I decided that a simple static content site wasn't interesting enough anymore and I wanted to develop something more complicated with the JAMStack ecosystem. The second iteration of my personal site also includes project posts, blog posts, tags and  programmatically generated projects using GraphQL.

The design is new and fresh and also features a (completely necessary) dark-mode toggle. If you want to know more about how I built this site, check out the repository on [github](https://github.com/yp717/personal-site-v2)!

This project on the website is in progress and a detailed description is coming soon.ðŸ¤­
