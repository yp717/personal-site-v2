Hi everyone! If you've found your way to this page you're probably looking for somee help with a college statistics class because statistics isn't always easy and certainly isn't always explained in the simplest way. This series of posts isn't comprehensive. It may not cover everything that you're looking to review or maybe get more help on but it's a start and I'm continuously updating the content to make it more relevant, engaging and useful. 

Since I'm new to the world of writing tutorials and blogging, I'm open to any feedback you have regarding my content. After all it is whoever is reading this that I'm writing it and maintaining it for. As time goes on, I may be able to cover other subjects or go into more depth on any of the areas covered.

For now please enjoy this picture of a cat because this blog is a work in progress and the actual content will be uploaded soon.
